# CSU GPU Station Helper

This Google Chrome extension lets you sign in to CSU GPU station once you have your login credentials saved, and also send you notifications when GPU is available.

Installation: Drag and drop crx file to your Chrome Extensions manager.

Note: This extension is just for academic usage; I spend almost two days learning to write Chrome extensions, which is exactly the first time to accomplish such a task with the help of Github. Hence,
please ensure that your username and password is always legal and right.
As for the extension, the principle which I regard the GPU as available if its power is lower than 20w at that query time, though it is not strictly proper.
A potential issue is that I could not figure out the session time of the official website, so it sometimes fails as the session expired. In that case, I recommend strongly to sign out and sign in again.

Question: Do not hesitate to put issues and also welcome to PR.
